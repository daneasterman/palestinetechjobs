            Why Palestine Tech Jobs?
          </h4>
          <p>
            At the time of writing, as Israel heads to its third election in
            less than a year, the end of the occupation and a just resolution to
            the Israel-Palestinian conflict appears further away than ever.
            Political change and progress for the Palestinian people has ground
            to a halt.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, the world is not standing still. While we cannot easily
            force our politicians to make the political changes needed, it is
            very literally in our hands to change the Palestinian economic
            situation for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technology has become the most dynamic economic force around the
            world, and in Palestine this is no exception. We believe that the
            growth of the startup sector, high-paying tech jobs and the
            knowledge economy provide the best path for the Palestinians to
            economic prosperity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Palestine Tech Jobs</strong> was founded on this basis.

            Why focus on remote jobs?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Put simply: remote work is the future, it just hasn't fully arrived
            yet. Freedom of movement has been obviously been denied to
            Palestinians for a long time now, but high-tech and knowledge work
            can help to bypass these physical limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with international companies can offer much higher wages
            than are currently available in Palestine. But these opportunities
            can also give tech workers valuable real-world experience they can
            use use to put back into Palestine's start-up economy.
